  Abstract                 = {{Bayesian networks and decision graphs are formal graphical languages for representation and communication of decision scenarios requiring reasoning under uncertainty. Their strengths are two-sided. It is easy for humans to construct and to understand them, and when communicated to a computer, they can easily be compiled. Furthermore, handy algorithms are developed for analyses of the models and for providing responses to a wide range of requests such as belief updating, determining optimal strategies, conflict analyses of evidence, and most probable explanation. The book emphasizes both the human and the computer side. Part I gives a thorough introduction to Bayesian networks as well as decision trees and infulence diagrams, and through examples and exercises, the reader is instructed in building graphical models from domain knowledge. This part is self-contained and it does not require other background than standard secondary school mathematics. Part II is devoted to the presentation of algorithms and complexity issues. This part is also self-contained, but it requires that the reader is familiar with working with texts in the mathematical language. The author also: *Provides a well-founded practical introduction to Bayesian networks, decision trees and influence diagrams *Gives several examples and exercises exploiting the computer systems for Bayesian netowrks and influence diagrams *Gives practical advice on constructiong Bayesian networks and influence diagrams from domain knowledge. *Embeds decision making into the framework of Bayesian networks *Presents in detail the currently most efficient algorithms for probability updating in Bayesian networks *Discusses a wide range of analyes tools and model requests together with algorithms for calculation of responses. *Gives a detailed presentation of the currently most efficient algorithm for solving influence diagrams.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This paper presents a Bayesian Network (BN)-based modeling method for cascading crisis events. Crisis events have occurred more frequently in recent years, such as typhoons, rainstorms, and floods, posing a great threat to humans. Addressing these crises requires a more effective method for crisis early-warning and disaster mitigation in crisis management. However, few modeling methods can combine the crisis chain reaction (macro-view) and the elements within the crisis event (micro-view) in a cascading crisis events. Existing classical methods fail to consider the causal relations linking the micro to macro level in crisis events, which affects the forecasting accuracy and effectiveness. Based on systems theory, this paper first abstracts the crisis event as a three-layer structure model consisting of input elements, state elements and output elements from a micro-view. Next, a cascading crisis events Bayesian Network (CCEBN) model is developed by merging the single crisis events Bayesian Networks (SCEBNs). This method efficiently combines the crisis event's micro-view and the macro-view. The proposed BN-based model makes it possible to forecast and analyze the chain reaction path and the potential losses due to a crisis event. Finally, sample application is provided to illustrate the utility of the model. The experimental results indicate that the method can effectively improve the forecasting accuracy. },

How do we do it? This review describes recent approaches to reverse-engineering human learning and cognitive development and, in parallel, engineering more humanlike machine learning systems. Computational models that perform probabilistic inference over hierarchies of flexibly structured representations can address some of the deepest questions about the nature and origins of human thought: How does abstract knowledge guide learning and reasoning from sparse data? What forms does our knowledge take, across different domains and tasks? And how is that abstract knowledge itself acquired?}},
